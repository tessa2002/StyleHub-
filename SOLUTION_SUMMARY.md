## 🔧 **Admin: How to Assign More Orders**

1. Login as **Admin**
2. Go to **Orders** page
3. Find unassigned orders (27 orders currently unassigned)
4. Click **"Assign"** button next to each order
5. Select **"tailor"** from the dropdown
6. Click **"Assign Tailor"**

The tailor will see the new orders immediately!

---

## 🚀 **How Order Assignment Works**

### Admin Side:
1. Admin opens Orders page
2. Clicks "Assign" button
3. Selects tailor from dropdown
4. Order is saved with `assignedTailor` field

### Tailor Side:
1. Tailor logs in
2. Frontend calls `/api/orders/assigned`
3. Backend queries: `Order.find({ assignedTailor: tailorId })`
4. Returns all matching orders
5. Dashboard displays the orders

---

## 📱 **Frontend Auto-Refresh**

The Tailor Dashboard automatically refreshes every **30 seconds** to check for new order assignments. No manual refresh needed!

---

## 🐛 **If Still Not Working**

### Check Console Logs:
When the tailor dashboard loads, you should see:
```
🔑 Token found: Yes
📊 Fetching dashboard data for tailor: [id]
📦 API Response: {orders: Array(8)}
✅ Loaded 8 orders
📋 Order List: [...]
📊 Stats Calculated: {total: 8, pending: 2, ...}
```

### Check Network Tab:
- Request to `/api/orders/assigned` should return Status: `200 OK`
- Response should contain array with 8 orders

### Common Issues:
1. **Wrong email/password** - Use tailor@gmail.com / tailor123
2. **Cached old token** - Clear localStorage
3. **Backend not running** - Start with `npm start` in backend folder
4. **Frontend not running** - Start with `npm start` in frontend folder

---

## 📂 **Diagnostic Scripts Created**

I've created helpful diagnostic scripts in `backend/scripts/`:

1. **debugTailorOrders.js** - Shows all orders and assignments
2. **testTailorLogin.js** - Tests the complete authentication flow
3. **testCompleteFlow.js** - Tests from login to fetching orders
4. **fixTailorPassword.js** - Resets tailor password to `tailor123`

Run any of these with:
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/[script-name].js
```

---

## ✅ **CONFIRMED WORKING**

I have tested and confirmed:
- ✅ Tailor can login
- ✅ Token is generated and valid
- ✅ API returns 8 orders
- ✅ All backend endpoints work correctly
- ✅ Database has correct data
- ✅ Order assignments are proper

**The system is working correctly!** The tailor just needs to login with the correct credentials and clear their browser cache.

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED  
**Action Required:** Tailor needs to login fresh with correct credentials
