# Fix Existing Orders - Instructions

## Problem
Your existing orders show:
- Total: ₹0 (should show actual amount)
- Payment: "No bill" (should show bill status)

## Solution
Run this API endpoint to fix all existing orders.

## Steps:

### Option 1: Using Browser Console (Recommended)

1. **Login to your customer account** at http://localhost:3000/login

2. **Open browser console** (Press F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console)

3. **Paste this code** in the console and press Enter:

```javascript
fetch('/api/portal/admin/fix-orders', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log('✅ Fix completed!', data);
  alert(`Success! Fixed ${data.fixedCount} orders and created ${data.billsCreated} bills.`);
  // Reload the orders page
  window.location.reload();
})
.catch(err => {
  console.error('❌ Error:', err);
  alert('Error fixing orders. Check console for details.');
});
```

4. **You should see an alert** saying how many orders were fixed

5. **Refresh your orders page** to see the updated amounts!

## What It Does:

For each order with totalAmount = 0, the script will:

1. ✅ Calculate totalAmount based on:
   - Garment type base price (Shirt: ₹800, Blouse: ₹800, Lehenga: ₹2,500, etc.)
   - Fabric cost (if shop fabric was used)
   - Embroidery cost (if embroidery was added)
   - Urgency charge (₹500 if urgent)
   - Fallback to items price or minimum ₹1,000

2. ✅ Create bills for orders that don't have bills

3. ✅ Update existing bills with correct amounts

---

## Expected Result:

After running the fix, your orders page will show:
- **Total:** Actual calculated amount (₹800, ₹1,200, etc.)
- **Payment:** Bill status (Pending/Paid)
- **Download Receipt:** Button for paid orders

---

## Verification:

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/portal/orders
2. Check that totals are no longer ₹0
3. Check that "No bill" is replaced with payment status
4. Try creating a new order to confirm everything works
