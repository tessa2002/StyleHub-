## 🗃️ Database Required

All these endpoints now **require MongoDB** to be running:

1. **`POST /api/auth/register`** - Register new users
2. **`POST /api/auth/login`** - Login users
3. **`GET /api/auth/verify`** - Verify tokens
4. **`GET /api/orders/assigned`** - Get assigned orders
5. **All other endpoints** - Real data from DB

**No more test mode fallbacks!**

## 📊 Empty States

When there's no data, you'll see proper empty states:

### Dashboard
```
📊 Total Orders: 0
⏳ Pending: 0
🛠 In Progress: 0
✅ Completed: 0
```

### My Orders
```
📋 No orders assigned yet
Your assigned orders will appear here
```

### In Progress
```
🛠 No orders in progress
Start working on an order from "My Orders"
```

### Ready to Deliver
```
✅ No orders ready
Complete your in-progress orders to see them here
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test with Real Data:

1. **Login as Admin**
2. **Assign an order to a tailor**
3. **Login as that tailor**
4. **Check dashboard** → Should see the assigned order
5. **Click "Start Work"** → Should see real order details
6. **No demo/test data anywhere!** ✅

### Test with No Data:

1. **Login as a new tailor** (with no assigned orders)
2. **Check dashboard** → Should show zeros
3. **Check "My Orders"** → Should show empty state
4. **No fake/demo orders!** ✅

---

## 🎯 Result

- ❌ Test accounts like `Customer@gmail.com`
- ❌ Mock data when DB unavailable
- ❌ Fake orders showing up
- ❌ Demo measurements

**After:**
- ✅ Only real users from database
- ✅ Only real orders assigned by admin
- ✅ Only real measurements from customers

## ✅ Verification

To verify no demo data exists:

```javascript
// Check if any test accounts exist
db.users.find({ email: { $regex: /test|demo|sample|mock/i } })
// Should return empty []

// Check if orders have real customers
db.orders.find({ customer: null })
// Should return empty []

// Check if measurements are real
db.orders.find({ measurements: {} })
// Orders without measurements (which is fine)
```
