# Payment Details Display - Complete Implementation

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Payment Model Created**
   - `backend/models/Payment.js` - Stores all payment transactions
   - Fields: amount, method, status, Razorpay IDs, transaction ID, date/time

### 2. **Payment Recording on Success**
   - When payment is verified, a Payment record is automatically created
   - Stores complete Razorpay transaction details
   - Updates bill status to "Paid"

### 3. **Payment Details Display on Orders Page**
   - Order Details modal shows comprehensive payment information
   - Payment history table with:
     - Date & Time
     - Payment Method
     - Amount Paid
     - Transaction ID (Razorpay Payment ID)
     - Status Badge

### 4. **Backend API Endpoint**
   - `/api/portal/payments/by-bill/:billId` - Fetches all payments for a bill
   - Returns payment history sorted by date (newest first)

### 5. **Test Order Created**
   - A test order with payment is now in your database
   - Login credentials: `customer@test.com` / `password123`

## 🚀 How to See Payment Details

### Step 1: Login
```
Email: customer@test.com
Password: password123
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Orders
- Click "Orders" in the left sidebar
- You should see at least one order (the test order we created)

### Step 3: View Order Details
- Click the "eye icon" (👁️) on any order
- A modal will open showing:

  - Order information
  - **Payment Details section** ⬅️ This is new!
  - Items ordered
  - Addresses

### Step 4: Payment Details Section
In the modal, you'll see a section titled "Payment Details" with a table showing:

| Date               | Method   | Amount | Transaction ID     | Status     |
|--------------------|----------|--------|-------------------|------------|
| 10/23/2025, 3:00PM | Razorpay | ₹1,500 | pay_test_12345... | ✓ Paid     |

## 🎨 What Payment Details Show
