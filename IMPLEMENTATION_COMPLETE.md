### ✅ Solution Delivered:

## 🎯 Part 1: Dynamic Payment Calculation

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Backend Order Creation** (`backend/routes/portal.js`)
   - ✅ Calculates base price by garment type
   - ✅ Adds fabric cost (if shop fabric selected)
   - ✅ Adds embroidery cost (with detailed pricing)
   - ✅ Adds urgency charges
   - ✅ Returns correct totalAmount

2. **Price Breakdown:**
```javascript
Base Prices:
- Shirt: ₹800
- Pants: ₹600
- Blouse: ₹800
- Lehenga: ₹2,500
- Suit: ₹2,000
- Dress: ₹1,200
- Kurta: ₹1,000
- Jacket: ₹1,500
- Other: ₹1,000

+ Fabric Cost (quantity × price per meter)
+ Embroidery Cost (type + placements + colors)
+ Urgency Charge (+₹500 if urgent)
= Total Amount
```

3. **Example Calculations:**
```
Blouse Order:
- Base: ₹800
- Fabric: 2m @ ₹200 = ₹400
- Hand Embroidery (collar + sleeves, 2 colors): ₹1,100
- Urgent Delivery: ₹500
= Total: ₹2,800 ✅

Lehenga Order:
- Base: ₹2,500
- Fabric: 5m @ ₹300 = ₹1,500
- No embroidery: ₹0
- Normal delivery: ₹0
= Total: ₹4,000 ✅
```

---

## 🎯 Part 2: Automatic Order Display & Receipt

### What Was Implemented:

#### 1. **Enhanced Bill Model** (`backend/models/Bill.js`)
```javascript
✅ billNumber: Auto-generated (BILL-001001, BILL-001002...)
✅ customer: Direct customer reference
✅ paidAt: Payment timestamp
✅ status: Pending/Partial/Paid
✅ Pre-save hook: Auto-generates bill numbers
```

#### 2. **Receipt Generation** (`backend/routes/portal.js`)
```javascript
✅ Endpoint: GET /api/portal/bills/:id/receipt
✅ Professional HTML receipt
✅ Printable format
✅ Customer details
✅ Order information
✅ Payment breakdown
✅ Security: Ownership verification
```

#### 3. **Customer Dashboard** (`frontend/src/pages/dashboards/CustomerDashboard.js`)
```javascript
✅ Recent orders table with payment status
✅ Color-coded payment badges
✅ Receipt download button for paid orders
✅ Real-time bill status updates
✅ Helper component: OrderRowDashboard
```

#### 4. **Orders Page** (`frontend/src/pages/portal/Orders.js`)
```javascript
✅ Payment status column
✅ "Pay Now" button for unpaid orders
✅ "Download Receipt" button for paid orders
✅ Bill number display in details
✅ Payment history section
```
